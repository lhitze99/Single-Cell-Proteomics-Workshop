#### SCP Workshop

Welcome to your first hands-on experience in single cell proteomics!

R Packages/Workshops we can use as a guide:

-   scp Package: <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/scp/inst/doc/scp.html>, <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/scp/inst/doc/scp_data_modelling.html>
-   QuantQC Package: <https://scp.slavovlab.net/QuantQC>
-   Small overview of some other commonly used tools for single cell proteomics analysis: <https://www.mtoz-biolabs.com/data-analysis-strategies-and-toolkits-for-single-cell-proteomics.html>

```{r}


if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.21")

# Pckage with functions for manipulating, processing, and analyzing mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics data
BiocManager::install("scp")

library("scp")

# Typical example of what you would get after reading in a CSV file
data("mqScpData")

# Example of a sample annotation table 
data("sampleAnnotation")
